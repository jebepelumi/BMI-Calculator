# BMI-Calculator
BMI calculator using NHS metrics 


A BMI calculation in the healthy weight range is between 18.5 to 24.9.

For Black, Asian and some other minority ethnic groups, the healthy weight range is 18.5 to 23.

For people of White heritage, a BMI:

below 18.5 is underweight
between 18.5 and 24.9 is healthy
between 25 and 29.9 is overweight
of 30 or over is obese
Black, Asian and some other minority ethnic groups have a higher risk of developing some long-term conditions such as type 2 diabetes with a lower BMI. People from these groups with a BMI of:

23 or more are at increased risk (overweight)
27.5 or more are at high risk (obese)
